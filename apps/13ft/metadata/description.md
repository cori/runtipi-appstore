# 13 Feet Ladder

## Description

13 Feet Ladder is a self-hosted server designed to bypass ads and paywalls on websites by pretending to be GoogleBot. This allows users to access content that would otherwise be restricted.

## How It Works

The server mimics Google's web crawler to fetch the full content of a webpage, allowing users to read articles without encountering paywalls or ads.

## Usage

1. **Access the Server**: Once the server is running, you can access it via the URL provided in the console.
2. **Bypass Paywalls**: Append the URL of the webpage you want to access to the server's URL. For example, if your server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, you can access `https://example.com` by visiting `http://127.0.0.1:5000/https://example.com`.

## Configuration Notes

- **Port**: The server exposes port 5000.
- **Environment Variables**: No specific environment variables are required.
- **Volumes**: No specific volumes are required for this setup, but you may need to configure volumes if you need persistent data storage.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed and configured on your system.
