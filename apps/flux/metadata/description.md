# Flux

## Graph-based LLM power tool for exploring many completions in parallel.

Flux is a power tool for interacting with large language models (LLMs) that generates multiple completions per prompt in a tree structure and lets you explore the best ones in parallel.

Flux's tree structure allows you to:

Get a wider variety of creative responses

Test out different prompts with the same shared context

Use inconsistencies to identify where the model is uncertain

It also provides a robust set of keyboard shortcuts, allows setting the system message and editing GPT messages, autosaves to local storage, uses the OpenAI API directly, and is 100% open source and MIT licensed.
