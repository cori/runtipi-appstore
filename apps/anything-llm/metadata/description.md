*AnythingLLM:* The all-in-one AI app you were looking for.

Chat with your docs, use AI Agents, hyper-configurable, multi-user, with no frustrating set up required.

Anything-LLM is a full-stack application that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. This application allows you to select which LLM or Vector Database you want to use, as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

## Usage on Tipi

During initial on-boarding you'll select a default LLM provider and model. Once on-boardng is complete, head over to the admin panel and enable multi-user mode and create an admin account. This will prevent AnythingLLM from restarting on-boarding after every restart.
